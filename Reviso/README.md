### Problem
```
As a part of the Reviso recruitment process we always ask our candidates to complete a practical
development challenge. The challenge consists of two parts:
1. You do your magic, solve the provided task, and send the results to us.
2. We host a session where you present your solution to us, and we all have a nice talk about it.

The task is to implement a simple web application that solves the following two user stories:
As a freelancer I want to be able to register the time I spend on my projects, so that I can create
correct invoices for my customers.

As a freelancer I want to be able to get an overview of my time registrations, so that I can create
correct invoices for my customers.
Keep in mind that we do not expect your code to be production ready. What we're looking for is to see
if you have the ability to transform a set of user requirements into a working tool, preferably
creating some nice and clean code along the way. We will appreciate if your solution is:
Working
Easy to use
SOLID
Maintainable
Testable
